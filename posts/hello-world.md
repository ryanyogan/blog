So it has been a very long time since I have written some words to the internet,
a lot has changed.  There are a few things that I have been working on lately
and the resources online are somewhat lacking.  I am going to write up a multi
part tutorial on React.js basic, Isopmorphic Js (react) w/ routing and how I
have this little gem running with Docker / Quay.io / Circle.ci so this will be
fun.
